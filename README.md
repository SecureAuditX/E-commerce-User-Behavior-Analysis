- Use **K-Means Clustering** to group users into meaningful segments.
- Visualize user segments and trends with an interactive **dashboard**.
- Suggest **targeted marketing strategies** per customer segment.
- Allow business stakeholders to **download segmented reports** for operational use.

### 💡 Precision Marketing Suggestions
| Segment    | Description                                 | Strategy |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| **VIP**    | High frequency, high spend, recent buyers   | Loyalty rewards, early access |
| **Loyal**  | Repeat customers, moderate spenders         | Upsell/cross-sell |
| **Churn Risk** | Previously active, now disengaged    | Win-back campaigns |
